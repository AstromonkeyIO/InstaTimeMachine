Tinder iOS Code Challenge by Tom Lee

- The iOS uses Instagram API to retrieve the last 20 photos from my Instagram account.
- The app is built in Swift.
- I'm not an Instagram power user so I only have 2 photos but the API is designated to pull the last 20 photos from my Instagram. 
- Thanks once again for reaching out! Hope to hear back from you guys soon!
